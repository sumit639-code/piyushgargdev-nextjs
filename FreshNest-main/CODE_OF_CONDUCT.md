FreshNest is committed to providing a safe, respectful and inclusive environment for all its contributors, collaborators, and users. We expect all members of our community to abide by the following code of conduct:

## Respect

We respect everyone’s identities, culture, and work. We expect all members of our community to:

- Treat each other with kindness, courtesy, and respect
- Listen actively, consider and acknowledge other people's opinions before responding
- Be inclusive and welcoming to everyone
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior

- Any form of sexual harassment or assault
  If you witness or experience any behavior that makes you feel unsafe, unwelcome, or uncomfortable, please report it to the maintainer or owner.

## Conflict Resolution

Disagreements and conflicts can arise in any community. We encourage all members of our community to:

- Work together to understand each other's perspectives
- Focus on finding a solution that addresses everyone's concerns
- Seek advice from a senior member of the project if needed
- Avoid **"agreement by attrition"** or **"agreement by compromise"** that doesn't address everyone's concerns

## Questions

We welcome questions and encourage our community to help each other. If you don't know something, don't be afraid to ask. Once you find the answer, document it in the first place you looked.

## Enforcement

FreshNest is committed to upholding this code of conduct. We expect everyone to adhere to these guidelines. We reserve the right to take appropriate action, including but not limited to:

- Warning the offender and reminding them of our code of conduct
- Asking the offender to leave the project or event immediately
- Temporarily or permanently banning the offender from participating in the project or community

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.
