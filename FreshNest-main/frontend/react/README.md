Replace [your-username] with your GitHub username.<br>

3. Navigate to the project directory by running the following command in your terminal: <br>

```
cd /frontend/react/
```

4. Add a `.env` file in your `/frontend/react/` folder and add the below line:

   - To use a local development server (preferred)
